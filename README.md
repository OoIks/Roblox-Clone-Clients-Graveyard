# Superium-Client
This is incomplete code from the Superiums Client! It is incomplete and has obfuscated function names due it being il2cpp and was decompiled like that! <b>THIS SOURCE MUST BE ONLY USED FOR LEARNING HOW SANDBOXES CLIENT WORKS AND PREVENT YOURSELF FROM USING THIS IN PRODUCTION</b>. If you are interested in looking how it works, you literally gotta run it. You will probably face issues with compiling the build! Thanks!

# PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS AS A SOURCE FOR YOUR OWN SANDBOX CLIENT! IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND CAN GET YOU SUED
